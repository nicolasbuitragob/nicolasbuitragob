## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Nicolas Buitrago. I am an environmental engineer focusing on data science and machine learning

Cycling is my second passion :bicyclist:

Data science for social good is the first :earth_americas:

If you have a project covering data science for social good, tell me how can I contribute to create value

Recently, I joined as a Junior machine learning engineer in Omdena to generate a real world impact with people around the globe
